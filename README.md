This workshop is an introductory hands-on course on doing a machine learning project in Python. It is aimed at students and professionals who want to learn the basics of data preparation, classification, regression, and model evaluation using the state-of-the-art machine learning library scikit-learn.

Familiarity with Python will be helpful, but programming skills in any other programming language would do as well.

## Prerequisites

The most elegant way to install the required software is by installing [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). You can either install:

* the entire set of packages in [Anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) **or**

* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) first, and manually add the following packages:
  
  ```
  conda install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
  conda install anaconda::jupyter
  ```
